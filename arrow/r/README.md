[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is a cross-language
development platform for in-memory data. It specifies a standardized
language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical
data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware. It
also provides computational libraries and zero-copy streaming messaging
and interprocess communication.

The `arrow` package exposes an interface to the Arrow C++ library to
access many of its features in R. This includes support for analyzing
large, multi-file datasets (`open_dataset()`), working with individual
Parquet (`read_parquet()`, `write_parquet()`) and Feather
(`read_feather()`, `write_feather()`) files, as well as lower-level
access to Arrow memory and messages.

## Installation

Install the latest release of `arrow` from CRAN with

```r
install.packages("arrow")
```

Conda users can install `arrow` from conda-forge with

```
conda install -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority r-arrow
```

Installing a released version of the `arrow` package requires no
additional system dependencies. For macOS and Windows, CRAN hosts binary
packages that contain the Arrow C++ library. On Linux, source package
installation will also build necessary C++ dependencies. For a faster,
more complete installation, set the environment variable `NOT_CRAN=true`.
See `vignette("install", package = "arrow")` for details.

## Installing a development version

Development versions of the package (binary and source) are built daily and hosted at
<https://arrow-r-nightly.s3.amazonaws.com>. To install from there:

``` r
install.packages("arrow", repos = "https://arrow-r-nightly.s3.amazonaws.com")
```

Or

```r
arrow::install_arrow(nightly = TRUE)
```

Conda users can install `arrow` nightlies from our nightlies channel using:

```
conda install -c arrow-nightlies -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority r-arrow
```

These daily package builds are not official Apache releases and are not
recommended for production use. They may be useful for testing bug fixes
and new features under active development.

## Developing

Windows and macOS users who wish to contribute to the R package and
don’t need to alter the Arrow C++ library may be able to obtain a
recent version of the library without building from source. On macOS,
you may install the C++ library using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

``` shell
# For the released version:
brew install apache-arrow
# Or for a development version, you can try:
brew install apache-arrow --HEAD
```

On Windows, you can download a .zip file with the arrow dependencies from the
[nightly repository](https://dl.bintray.com/ursalabs/arrow-r/libarrow/bin/windows/),
and then set the `RWINLIB_LOCAL` environment variable to point to that
zip file before installing the `arrow` R package. Version numbers in that
repository correspond to dates, and you will likely want the most recent.

If you need to alter both the Arrow C++ library and the R package code,
or if you can’t get a binary version of the latest C++ library
elsewhere, you’ll need to build it from source too.

First, install the C++ library. See the [developer
guide](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp/building.html) for details.
It's recommended to make a `build` directory inside of the `cpp` directory of
the Arrow git repository (it is git-ignored). Assuming you are inside `cpp/build`,
you'll first call `cmake` to configure the build and then `make install`.
For the R package, you'll need to enable several features in the C++ library
using `-D` flags:

```
cmake \
  -DARROW_COMPUTE=ON \
  -DARROW_CSV=ON \
  -DARROW_DATASET=ON \
  -DARROW_FILESYSTEM=ON \
  -DARROW_JEMALLOC=ON \
  -DARROW_JSON=ON \
  -DARROW_PARQUET=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release \
  -DARROW_INSTALL_NAME_RPATH=OFF \
  ..
```

where `..` is the path to the `cpp/` directory when you're in `cpp/build`.

To enable optional features including S3 support, an alternative memory allocator, and additional compression libraries, add some or all of these flags:

```
  -DARROW_S3=ON \
  -DARROW_MIMALLOC=ON \
  -DARROW_WITH_BROTLI=ON \
  -DARROW_WITH_BZ2=ON \
  -DARROW_WITH_LZ4=ON \
  -DARROW_WITH_SNAPPY=ON \
  -DARROW_WITH_ZLIB=ON \
  -DARROW_WITH_ZSTD=ON \
```

Other flags that may be useful:

* `-DARROW_EXTRA_ERROR_CONTEXT=ON` makes errors coming from the C++ library point to files and line numbers
* `-DBOOST_SOURCE=BUNDLED`, for example, or any other dependency `*_SOURCE`, if you have a system version of a C++ dependency that doesn't work correctly with Arrow. This tells the build to compile its own version of the dependency from source.

Note that after any change to the C++ library, you must reinstall it and
run `make clean` or `git clean -fdx .` to remove any cached object code
in the `r/src/` directory before reinstalling the R package. This is
only necessary if you make changes to the C++ library source; you do not
need to manually purge object files if you are only editing R or C++
code inside `r/`.

Once you’ve built the C++ library, you can install the R package and its
dependencies, along with additional dev dependencies, from the git
checkout:

``` shell
cd ../../r
R -e 'install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "pkgdown", "covr")); devtools::install_dev_deps()'
R CMD INSTALL .
```

If you need to set any compilation flags while building the C++
extensions, you can use the `ARROW_R_CXXFLAGS` environment variable. For
example, if you are using `perf` to profile the R extensions, you may
need to set

``` shell
export ARROW_R_CXXFLAGS=-fno-omit-frame-pointer
```

If the package fails to install/load with an error like this:

    ** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location
    Error: package or namespace load failed for 'arrow' in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
    unable to load shared object '/Users/you/R/00LOCK-r/00new/arrow/libs/arrow.so':
    dlopen(/Users/you/R/00LOCK-r/00new/arrow/libs/arrow.so, 6): Library not loaded: @rpath/libarrow.14.dylib

ensure that `-DARROW_INSTALL_NAME_RPATH=OFF` was passed (this is important on 
macOS to prevent problems at link time and is a no-op on other platforms). 
Alternativelly, try setting the environment variable `R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to 
wherever Arrow C++ was put in `make install`, e.g. `export
R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib`, and retry installing the R package.

When installing from source, if the R and C++ library versions do not
match, installation may fail. If you’ve previously installed the
libraries and want to upgrade the R package, you’ll need to update the
Arrow C++ library first.

For any other build/configuration challenges, see the [C++ developer
guide](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp/building.html) and
`vignette("install", package = "arrow")`.

### Editing C++ code

The `arrow` package uses some customized tools on top of `cpp11` to
prepare its C++ code in `src/`. If you change C++ code in the R package,
you will need to set the `ARROW_R_DEV` environment variable to `TRUE`
(optionally, add it to your`~/.Renviron` file to persist across
sessions) so that the `data-raw/codegen.R` file is used for code
generation.

We use Google C++ style in our C++ code. Check for style errors with

    ./lint.sh

Fix any style issues before committing with

    ./lint.sh --fix

The lint script requires Python 3 and `clang-format-8`. If the command
isn’t found, you can explicitly provide the path to it like
`CLANG_FORMAT=$(which clang-format-8) ./lint.sh`. On macOS, you can get
this by installing LLVM via Homebrew and running the script as
`CLANG_FORMAT=$(brew --prefix llvm@8)/bin/clang-format ./lint.sh`

### Running tests

Some tests are conditionally enabled based on the availability of certain
features in the package build (S3 support, compression libraries, etc.).
Others are generally skipped by default but can be enabled with environment
variables or other settings:

* All tests are skipped on Linux if the package builds without the C++ libarrow.
  To make the build fail if libarrow is not available (as in, to test that
  the C++ build was successful), set `TEST_R_WITH_ARROW=TRUE`
* Some tests are disabled unless `ARROW_R_DEV=TRUE`
* Tests that require allocating >2GB of memory to test Large types are disabled
  unless `ARROW_LARGE_MEMORY_TESTS=TRUE`
* Integration tests against a real S3 bucket are disabled unless credentials
  are set in `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; these are available
  on request
* S3 tests using [MinIO](https://min.io/) locally are enabled if the
  `minio server` process is found running. If you're running MinIO with custom
  settings, you can set `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY`, `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`, and
  `MINIO_PORT` to override the defaults.

### Useful functions

Within an R session, these can help with package development:

``` r
devtools::load_all() # Load the dev package
devtools::test(filter="^regexp$") # Run the test suite, optionally filtering file names
devtools::document() # Update roxygen documentation
pkgdown::build_site() # To preview the documentation website
devtools::check() # All package checks; see also below
covr::package_coverage() # See test coverage statistics
```

Any of those can be run from the command line by wrapping them in `R -e
'$COMMAND'`. There’s also a `Makefile` to help with some common tasks
from the command line (`make test`, `make doc`, `make clean`, etc.)

### Full package validation

``` shell
R CMD build .
R CMD check arrow_*.tar.gz --as-cran
```
